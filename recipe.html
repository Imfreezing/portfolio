        <h1>Chiles Rellenos</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <div class="peter">
        <p>According to the history of chiles rellenos dates back to the Spanish Conquest.
        The act of stuffing peppers itself would actually date all the way back to the Ottoman era, all the way in the 1200's!
        For that <i>that</i> specific dish, they would fill peppers with a whole assortment of things; like meat, onions, and herbs and spices.
        </p>
        <p>This was before the Spanish Conquest in the 1600's, where it is said that Chiles Rellenos had originated. Nuns in now Puebla,
        Mexico would allegedly make the dish for the Mexican General that was involved in the Mexican victory in Puebla on May 5th.
        Back then the name and even presentation and ingredients of the dish would be different!
        The Nuns would cover the chiles in un salsa de nogal (a walnut sauce) and also use pomegranates as a garnish! These chiles were also stuffed
        with ground beef, nuts, fruits, similar to the dish in the Ottoman Empire! Though that is allegedly the first documenting of the dish, many historians believe that the dish had been around for longer,
        being made by Mestizo other Indigenous people. The actual origin by <i>the</i> chile relleno is still a bit unknown on the exact pinpoints,
        but this variation would come from New Mexico. Though it's not exactly said which restaurants had originally started to serve this dish.</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>For the chiles rellenos</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Roast the chiles:</u> Turn on the stove to medium heat and place the chiles directly on there.
            Roast the chiles for about 5 minutes (or until the skin is black and blistering) then flip and do the same on that side, repeat with each chile.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the chiles from the stovetop and set them aside to cool off</li>
            <li><u>Peel the chiles:</u> Once the chiles are cooled off, try to peel and rub off as possible from the loose skin (repeat with each chile).</li>
            <li>Cut a slit down each of the peppers, but make sure to not cut the pepper all the way in half</li>
            <li><u>Stuff the peppers:</u> Carefully stuff the peppers with cheese, some of the chiles may come apart easily but thats okay.</li>
            <li>Gently close the chiles and secure it by sticking about 2-3 toothpicks through them.</li>
            <li><u>Prepare for frying:</u> Heat the oil in a large saucepan or deep skillet over medium heat. Set aside a plate with 2 pieces of paper towels on it, you will put the cooked chiles on this.</li>
            <li><u>Make the batter:</u> Separate the eggs so that the egg whites are in a large mixing bowl and the egg yolks are in a small bowl. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>While beating the egg whites on low, slowly add in the egg yolks.</li>
            <li><u>Coat the chiles with the batter:</u> Place the flour and salt in a separate shallow bowl/plate, mix to combine. Gently roll the chiles in the flour, then in the batter, and gently place into the hot oil (repeat with each chile)</li>
            <li><u>Fry the chiles rellenos:</u> Fry each side for 3-5 minutes, or until golden and crispy (don't overcrowd the oil pan with chiles)</li>
            <li>Transfer them to the plate with paper towels to drain excess oil and you're done!</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>For the salsa roja:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the jalapenos into a pot with water to cook.</li>
            <li>Cook until the jalapenos turn a lighter green, then add in the tomatoes.</li>
